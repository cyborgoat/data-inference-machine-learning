## Question 1

---

- Mean: 6753.636363636364

- Standard Deviation: 1088.9717646166182

- Standard Error of the Mean: 344.3631083801271

- Degrees of Freedom: 10  

- t-statistic: -2.8207540608310198 

- P Value:0.018137235176105812  

- Since the data comes from a normal distribution, and the mean value is about 6753KJ (which is smaller than 7725KJ), a **left tail test** is appropriate.
- Because the P value is pretty small, the null hypothesis should be rejected.

## Question 2

---

- t-score: 11.647653131319812 
- p-value: 2.315890162874227e-19
- A **two-sample test** is appropriate since  the GOES of Ireland and Elsewhere are independent to each other.
- A right tail is appropriate since the test is about test if the GOES in Irish pub tastes **significantly better** than elsewhere around the global.

<center>Fig 3.1 Fertility rate versus GDP per capita</center>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
- Correlation Coefficient = -0.537393
- Interpolation: The result is showing a **Negative Correlation** which menas the higher rate of fertility somehow leads to lower GDP percapita and vise versa.

- From the ACF of monthly data, there is indeed evidence of seasonlity according to the P-value with different lags, whereas the graph is somehow representing symmetrical nature which can be treated as an evidece for the house house price is relevent to certian time periods.
- From the time series, the average house price is generally increasing over time, but with a hugh amount of drop at the year of 2018.
-  What is the annualized return over this period as a percentage?
